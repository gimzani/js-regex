# js-regex

I needed a way of creating, testing and storing Regular Expressions in JavaScript.  I had originally wrote this as a web app for ASP.NET, but with my discovery of Electron, I wanted a nice little project (that was actually useful) to make a product from.

I think this fits the bill.

## Technology

This app is written in VueJS and is running in an Electron shell.

If you want to add to it, you will need to have NodeJS installed.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Run Application in dev mode
```
npm start
```

## Build Application
```
npm run build
```
